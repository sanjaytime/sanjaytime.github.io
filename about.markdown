Hi I'm Sanjay Narayanan.

![lalala](https://www.dropbox.com/s/eayqrx0gzpqkzxd/selfie-portrait-flowers.jpeg?dl=0)

I am a software engineer that is interested in the Data Engineering and artificial intelligence spaces.  I am using this site to share prompts and responses from various large-language models, and potentially share any tools that I have built.

I built this site using [jekyll][jekyll-organization] and [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).  You can find the source code for this [site here](https://github.com/sanjaytime/sanjaytime.github.io).
